Advanced students learn to perform a physical examination, obtain a patient history and evaluate patient information. The first year student will spend 3 weeks shadowing a clinician-mentor in the ambulatory or hospital setting. The experience is meant to introduce the student to the practice of medicine (broadly defined) and allows the student to practice targeted parts of the medical interview and physical exam. The hands-on learning that these sessions provide is a complement to the basic science courses and physical examination skills obtained in Dental school. A critical component of this education exercise should be on observation of the medical interview in action and observing aspects of the patient-doctor relationship. Limited skills such as interviewing for an HPI, taking a family history, checking vital signs, and holding an otoscope will also be covered. Topics range from how to take vital signs to enhancing awareness of cross-cultural issues. The mentor will need to help the student complete the assignment by arranging for the student to spend a little extra time with a patient each week or two. In some cases the mentor will choose to discuss with the student how s/he approaches a certain topic (for example, how to screen for domestic violence in the pediatric setting.',\n",

Lectures will demonstrate the importance of integrating a patient's medical and dental history with biomedical sciences at a molecular or organ systems level. The student will demonstrate mastery of biomedical science through an understanding of disease etiology, and integrating that into prognosis, risk analysis and treatment. Time will be spent demonstrating how to effectively analyze information collected in the comprehensive oral evaluation in light of best practices, patients desires and understanding and other modifying factors. The students learn skills that enable them to evaluate a patient's needs and develop an orderly, prioritized and sequential course of treatment that is problem-based. They will be able to develop a recommended plan as well as an alternative plan of therapy and support their decisions based on the available evidence in the dental literature. Utilizing treatment plans presented during students' clinical work, the student learns to present this information in a way that enables the patient to conceptualize what treatment and to co-participate in an informed fashion in the development of their treatment plan.

In many instances, the development of these new fields goes hand in hand with development of new experimental approaches to surveying the content of the cell. While, traditional molecular cell biology and biochemistry courses often focus on the basic details of cell physiology and macromolecular (DNA, lipid, protein) structures, they too often neglect the quantitative aspects of number, scale, forces, etc. that are crucial to providing a larger context within living systems. This course aims at reframing the basic concepts of cell and molecular biology in a quantitative context and providing a basic overview of some of the key approaches used to develop a quantitative framework inside the cell.

These two courses (DS-791 and DS-792) are designed to provide graduate students with the practical training necessary to be effective teachers not only in classroom settings but also in research settings that require the communication of technical concepts to peers and mentees. In DS-791, students will be assigned as teaching fellows working as apprentices under a faculty member in support of various teaching duties. Depending on the nature of the teaching assignment, this may include leading discussion sections or labs, offering office hours to assist learners with homework assignments, engaging with learners through online learning management systems, helping with learning assessments, etc. In addition, students are expected to participate in regular meeting of the two courses (DS-791 and DS-792) that introduce them to pedagogical innovation and best practices in communicating and teaching a variety of data science subjects.',\n",

The course surveys the roots of contemporary art and pedagogy and the shift to postmodernism, including influential figures, theories, and trends and their impact on art education. A deep-dive investigation into masks as universal but complex, culturally-embedded phenomena provides students in the course with a unique lens. Students investigate the popularity of masks in global contemporary art and the roots of these masks that speak to culture, identity, privacy, and other issues of the moment. Responding to course content by creating art, students stretch and expand their knowledge of the mask form and use it as a tool to examine pressing issues in the contemporary art classroom. The in-depth focus enriches the background, ideas, and approaches teachers can bring to mask making, a valuable but often challenging project, but also use as a model. Through e-portfolio and online discussions, students create a community of learners.

Lithography is one of the oldest printmaking mediums, but perhaps the most versatile. It can mimic a pastel drawing, a watercolor, a fine line engraving or a photograph, utilizing both traditional stone as well as aluminum plates and other substrates. The intrinsic nature of a print involves drawing, creating multiples, opacities and transparencies utilizing various materials as drawing tools. Color layering and sequences, building upon an image and taking it away again, all lead to the versatility of the medium. Color mixing, ink modification, registration and the printing of multiple-run lithographs will be taught, with an emphasis on experimentation in size, series, and thinking beyond the flat surface. A disciplined approach to cooperative print shop use, how a professional print atelier runs, and proper care and maintenance of equipment will be covered. Students will build confidence in printing editions, working collaboratively with invited artists, and developing work that supports and extends their overall studio practice. Critiques, both one-on-one and in groups, combined with presentations on well-known artists, visits to professional print ateliers and print collections, and guest speakers will showcase current trends in the medium and its part in the contemporary printmaking landscape.

A variety of media and concepts are introduced and explored and the participants engage in arts-based research, using their insights to design learning experiences that enhance critical and creative development. As a culmination, the students develop unit and lesson plans. Taken in the final year before a student's practicum experiences, students concurrently enroll in the 1-credit CFA AR 662: Secondary Pre-practicum. Students must pass components of a Gateway Assessment in CFA AR586: Child Growth and Development in Art Education and CFA AR 559: Contemporary Issues in Art Education to begin their practicums.

Do you sometimes feel as though you are drifting from topic to topic with no long-range plan about what should be taught across the grades? Such thoughts are common among music teachers -- you are not alone! One way to allay them is to design units that focus on a limited number of important skills and knowledge that will endure, causing your students to remain musically competent, confident, and engaged throughout their lives. Course participants learn to identify core music learnings and how to present these in ways that cause them to be retained, to transfer, and to contribute to lifelong musical engagement. Based on the \"backward planning paradigm\" from Understanding by Design (Wiggins and McTighe) adapted for music teachers with limited contact time, this course presents a common sense approach to unit development through vivid (and often humorous) activities. Participants leave with a renewed sense of purpose in their planning, determination to teach fewer things in a deeper and more sequential manner, and understanding about what makes musical learning endure.',\n",

Although this course is a companion to the above courses, it is self-contained and discrete. For students who have taken any of the above-mentioned courses, they may already be awakened to the issues of systemic marginalization. For others, this course may serve as a general introduction to social justice and music education. This course intends to cover a body of equity and justice theories as a means of impelling a reconsideration of music education curricula to deepen the students' reflection, and to foster a strong connection between justice and music education. Students will participate in group discussions and individual reflections to increase awareness of justice and equity particularly as they relate to themselves as music educators. As part of this process, students will engage in project development. Upon completion of the course, students should be better prepared to engage in acts of social justice and to work for music education as a force for social change.\",\n",

Students will study how African American classical composers, including Florence Price, visual artist Aaron David, choreographer Alvin Ailey and American novelist Toni Morrison have utilized spirituals as reference material through direct quotations, themes, variations and performances.\\nBy focusing on this musical expression and the strength of human spirit expressed through this music, students will learn how enslaved peoples maintained their dignity, resisted the dehumanizing impact of slavery, and fought to preserve key cultural and linguistic elements even in the midst of the horrible oppression of slavery.\\nFinally, students will examine why Spirituals have played a significant role as vehicles for protest at intermittent points during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries around the world including Russia, Eastern Europe, China and South Africa. Some of today’s well-known pop artists continue to draw on the spirituals tradition in the creation of new protest songs. Examples include Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song” and Bill Bragg’s “Sing their souls back home.”',\n",

We will look at the pertinent scholarship involved in preparing performances, the controversies that arise, and possible solutions.  In dealing with music before 1600, issues of instrumentation, notation, ornamentation, and context are both complicated and crucial, and we will examine the relevant scholarship and recordings.  After 1800, performance issues can be just as difficult to confirm.  One of the goals of the course is to introduce you to the value of using original sources and the many issues – execution, context, flexibility, tempo and other markings and choice of instrument – that arise from them, so that your own performances take into account the various historical issues that are critical for performing ¬– and teaching ¬– this repertoire.
